> This project is a game built in vue.js  to put the learned concepts into practice about condicionals, lists, and DOM manipulation

What I've learned?
manipulate DOM with, v-if, v-bind, working with computed, data, methods and watch.

Features:
You can attack  , special attack, heal, or give up!
logs from the battle detaling the damage /heal from player and monster.

The monster always do more damage than you, unless you use your special attack, and use wisely you heal because when you heal you'll be open to receive a monster attack!
